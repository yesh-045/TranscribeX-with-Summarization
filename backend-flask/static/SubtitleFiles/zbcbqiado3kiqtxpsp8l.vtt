for you. I have only a five friends. You must be lonely.

01:12.716 --> 01:16.180
I will share my friends with you. That's very nice of you. My ear

01:16.212 --> 01:20.238
is killing me. What is the matter? I was on a plane. So every

01:20.286 --> 01:23.902
time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt. That's no good.

01:23.998 --> 01:26.918
Sometimes the pain goes away and sometimes it doesn't.

01:27.006 --> 01:30.206
Have you seen a doctor? I've been to three doctors. And they

01:30.230 --> 01:33.614
couldn't fix your problem. They said I have to live with it. Or you can

01:33.654 --> 01:37.606
stay off planes. Yes. It was nice talking to you, but I have

01:37.630 --> 01:38.630
to go. Okay.
