00:26.366 --> 00:29.624

00:29.744 --> 00:33.480
But I need money. Yes, I understand. Where do you want

00:33.512 --> 00:37.016

00:43.880 --> 00:47.120
a manager. I love my job. That's great. I am happy

00:50.456 --> 00:54.444
Really? How many do you have? I don't know. Maybe 1000.

00:54.564 --> 00:58.244
That is a lot of friends. I don't believe. Check out the number of friends

00:58.284 --> 01:01.604
I have on Facebook. Do you have a best friend? Of course.

01:01.724 --> 01:05.348

I think about 30. I have only one best friend. I feel sorry

01:09.252 --> 01:12.628
for you. I have only a five friends. You must be lonely.

01:12.716 --> 01:16.180
I will share my friends with you. That's very nice of you. My ear

01:16.212 --> 01:20.238
is killing me. What is the matter? I was on a plane. So every

01:20.286 --> 01:23.902
time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt. That's no good.

01:23.998 --> 01:26.918
Sometimes the pain goes away and sometimes it doesn't.

01:27.006 --> 01:30.206
Have you seen a doctor? I've been to three doctors. And they

01:30.230 --> 01:33.614
couldn't fix your problem. They said I have to live with it. Or you can

01:33.654 --> 01:37.606
stay off planes. Yes. It was nice talking to you, but I have

01:37.630 --> 01:38.630
to go. Okay.
